        <p>a man lives next door to a monastery. when he tries to sleep, he hears a strange sound coming from next door. every night. he decides that this cannot continue. one day he knocks on the door of the monastery, a monk walks out, let’s say half the height of the man. they converse briefly, the man asks what the noise is. <span>you’re not a monk</span>, the monk responds, thus he cannot be told the source of the noise. dying of curiosity, the man asks how he can become a monk. it’s quite easy, the monk responds, i’m feeling awfully thirsty and would like some tea. oolong, if you don’t mind. first, the monk lists, you must get the highest leaf from the highest tree on the highest mountain, i will drink nothing less. and so the man travels to nepal, i think that’s where the highest mountains are, and he hikes. he hikes and hikes and hikes all the way to the peak, but not before a close call with a dragon. escaping with his life, he summits the peak and sees the highest tree. grabbing the trunk, he shimmies up and plucks the topmost leaf before returning to the monastery. good, the monk says, now we must wait for them to be dry. while we wait, how about the second task. second, the monk lists, you must obtain water from the fastest of rivers, i will drink nothing less. and so the man travels, after a decade of research, to the fastest river in the world. the rushing waters do nothing to dissuade the desperate man, ever curious to learn the secrets of the monastery. yet, he knows he must be careful. one slip and his little journey would come to a damp end, the river would tear him to shreds, and so he slowly moves his hand towards the water, bottle in hand. a droplet hits his face and he flinches, in the process losing grip. of the bottle that is, and before he can react it’s gone, carried by the unrelenting current. the man knew this would happen, and retrieves a spare bottle, successfully obtaining the water before returning to the monastery. good, the monk says, in the thirty years you have dedicated yourself to this monastery, the leaves have dried. your final task, the monk lists, is to prepare the tea and return to me. however, the leaves refuse to steep in normal boiling water, the water must be heated by a flame hotter than the sun itself, only then can you brew the tea. the man is dumbfounded. pondering endlessly, years pass, the man’s hair is greyed and long, and wrinkles mark every facet of his body. he ponders. a fire hotter than the sun itself... the breath of the dragon. rushing onto the next flight, the man takes off for nepal. he hikes and hikes, more determined than ever to finish his quest. the dragon that nearly took his life all those decades ago sees the man and rises. incensed, the dragon breathes a plume of fire directly at the man. however, the man prepared himself for this moment, and holds the pot in front of him, containing his life’s work. it’s done, he thinks. he heads back. it’s dark, the monk lies on their deathbed. good, the monk says, good. the monk closes their eyes for the last time. the man sees the door, the sound floods his ears once more. he opens the door. what he sees, i wish i could tell you, but</p>
